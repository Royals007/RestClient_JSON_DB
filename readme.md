## RestFul API (05_RestService_d_0.1)

- implemented Controller with routes (not with POSTMAN or...)
- RestService Application.java is different when we use remote applications.

## RestFul API (05_RestService_d_0.2) extended routes and uses POSTMAN

- we don't need MYSQL und DB in this project
- worked with restful API data with POSTMAN
